### Setting the application logo
The application name changes depending on where it is deployed. 
**Blockly Local** refers to the local, offline version of the
application. **Blockly Solo** refers to the online version of
the same application.

The branding is accomplished by copying the correct HTML template
file (inc_logo_local.html or inc_logo_solo.html) to the staging 
folder and overwriting the contents of the inc_logo.html file.
