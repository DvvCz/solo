# Solo++

My fork of [Parallax Inc's Solo Propeller C Blockly Editor](https://github.com/parallaxinc/solo).  
This was made out of pretty much frustration with features when using this for a school project and lack of raw propeller C access.

## Differences

* Dark Mode
Both the ace editor and blockly editors are in dark mode now.

* ``code`` block
New ``code`` block is added to the blockly editor (system tab), which just inserts code (almost) inline, besides adding a new line.
Much smaller and easier to use than the regular ``User defined code`` block.
